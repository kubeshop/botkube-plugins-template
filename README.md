# Botkube Plugins

This repository shows the example Botkube [source](https://docs.botkube.io/architecture/#source) and [executor](https://docs.botkube.io/architecture/#executor) plugins.

It is intended as a template repository to start developing Botkube plugins in Go. Repository contains:

- The [`echo`](cmd/echo/main.go) executor that sends back the command that was specified,
- The [`ticker`](cmd/ticker/main.go) source that emits an event each time the configured time duration elapses,
- The [`msg`](cmd/msg/main.go) executor that showcases the interactive message capabilities,
- The release [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) jobs:
	- that creates [GitHub release](.github/workflows/release.yml) with plugin binaries and index file each time a new tag is pushed.
		- See: https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube-plugins-template/releases/latest
	- that updates [GitHub Pages](.github/workflows/pages-release.yml) with plugin binaries and index file each time a new tag is pushed.
